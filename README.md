Dhirana is a University of Pittsburgh non-profit organization that raises funds for the Birmingham Free Clinic. It brings in $10,000+ each year through hosting a national Indian classical dance competition where 8 teams from all over the United States compete for 1st place.

I served as the Design Chair for the organization for two year and I made the website, logos, numerous flyers, and over 10+ promotional videos for Dhirana 2015 and 2016.

The Dhirana 2016 website can be found [**here**](http://www.dhirana.com/).
